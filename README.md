# About the app

This is an e-shop web application written using Typescript, REACT (frontend), EXPRESS (backend) and MongoDB (database). The styling in the frontend is done using TailwindCSS framework. The frontend is hosted at [https://lucid-lewin-704e07.netlify.app/](https://lucid-lewin-704e07.netlify.app/) while the server is deployed at [https://my-eshop.onrender.com/](https://my-eshop.onrender.com/). Initially, it may take several minutes to load the app because the deployed backend takes a while to be active. The free deployment in [https://render.com/](https://render.com/) takes sometime to initialize.
